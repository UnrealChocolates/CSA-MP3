# 2024 Question 1

## This question is about:

- Completing the SimulateOneDay Method which returns the remaining food after one day
  
- Completing the SimulateManyDays Method which returns the number of days that birds or a bear found food at the feeder.

- If the simulated food consumed is greater than the amount of food in the feeder, the birds empty the
feeder and the amount of food in the feeder at the end of the day is zero. This will also go zero if a bear has found and eatten the all food. 

## Struggles with this question...

- The struggle with this question I experienced was that you have to know what loops is appropriate or not. In the case of this, it is perferable to use a while loop than a enchanced for loop. 

## Prior expereiences that helped...

- Prior experiences that had helped was how to use Math.Random() to randomize the output from a range of numbers. This can be done with int randomNumber = (int) ((Math.random() * (max - min +1) + min));. 
  
- Additionally the experience of creating RNG/Chances in formula int chances = (int) ((Math.random() * 100 + 1)); allowed me to create the RNG that decides if a bear would appear or not.

## What I learned by doing this question...

- Question 1 challanges the individual on the basics of coding which involves creating RNG or Random number generator and then checks the chances that the RNG had generated if one action is executed instead of the other.

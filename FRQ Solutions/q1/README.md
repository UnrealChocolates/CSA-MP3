# 2024 Question 1

## This question is about:

- Completing the SimulateOneDay Method which returns the remaining food after one day
  
- Completing the SimulateManyDays Method which returns the number of days that birds or a bear found food at the feeder.

- If the simulated food consumed is greater than the amount of food in the feeder, the birds empty the
feeder and the amount of food in the feeder at the end of the day is zero. This will also go zero if a bear has found and eatten the all food.

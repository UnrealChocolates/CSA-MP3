# 2024 Question 3

## This question is about...
- This question involves the manipulation and analysis of a list of words. The following WordChecker
class contains an ArrayList<String> to be analyzed and methods that are used to perform the
analysis.
- private ArrayList<String> wordList; will return true if each element of wordList (except the first) contains the previous element as a substring and returns false otherwise
- public boolean isWordChain() will returns an ArrayList<String> based on strings from wordList that start with target and each element of the returned ArrayList has had the initial occurrence of target removed.
## Struggles with this question...
- Honestly the struggles was understanding the (word.indexOf(insertwordhere)'s purpose and what it does, in the actual test i didn't know but after review i learned that it is a boolean on if a word appears in the array


## Prior expereiences that helped...
- The prior experiences that helped was the use of the for loop and for loop in looping through the index of the array and if statements to check if the boolean is true or not.


## What I learned by doing this question...
- (word.indexOf(insertwordhere) is a boolean statement

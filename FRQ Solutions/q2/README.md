# 2024 Question 2

## This question is about...
- Create a custom class that represents a scoreboard for a sporting event
- Mangaging all of the data, such as team names, scores, and which team is active
- Updating instance variables to keep track of when a team scored
- Creating an output statement to show the current standing of the game
  
## Struggles with this question...

- The struggle I faced this question is actually just doubting myself that it was this simple which led to me thinking it was a lot more complicated.

## Prior expereiences that helped...

- The prior experiences that helped with this question is that in boolean statements, if the boolean statement is true, it is not required to check if it is true by if (booleanStatement = true) but you can simply just do if(booleanStatement).

## What I learned by doing this question...

- Question 2 challanges the individual student on the concepts of boolean and in the case of this question, on which team is active.
